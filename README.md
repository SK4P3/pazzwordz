This is an open-source password manager. Yesterday we needed to share a password but because we might
be slightly autistic and have ADHD, we thought: "Why not just make a quick web-ui to do it?".
In hindsight, it's like deciding to throw a dinner party but ending up constructing
a five-star restaurant from scratch. Anyway, the password manager is now done,
and you can use it for free at [pazzwordz.io](https://www.pazzwordz.io).
